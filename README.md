# Task 4: Cloud Security Implementation

## Abstract
For this task, I implemented key cloud security practices using AWS. I created a custom IAM policy to grant read-only access to a specific S3 bucket and attached it to a programmatic-only IAM user. Additionally, I verified that default server-side encryption (SSE-S3) was enabled on the bucket to ensure secure storage of objects.

## Files Included
- Screenshot of IAM policy
- Screenshot of IAM user with attached policy
- Screenshot of S3 encryption configuration

## Tools Used
- AWS IAM
- AWS S3
